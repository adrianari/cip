# HSLU group project - CIP

In the CIP module, it was all about "Collection - Integration - Processing". Specifically, the task was to scrape data with Python and to make a comparative analysis of the data sources.

The main work that is finely strctured and cleaned is integrated into the folder "Abgabe".
